	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>The rLoop project is a diverse group of talented volunteers from around the world, currently in the early stages of creating a hyperloop pod design for SpaceX's <a href="http://spacex.com/hyperloop/" target="_blank">Hyperloop pod competition</a>. We have no official affiliation with Reddit or SpaceX.</p>
